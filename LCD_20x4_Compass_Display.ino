3-Axis Compass Module (HMC5883) Demo code.
Usage: 1. Run as is - it prints out detailed information on the compass heading
       2. It is important to calibrate the magnetormeters on the site where you use it.

   atan2(y, x) is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis of a plane and the point
   given by the coordinates (x, y) on it.

   This sketch does not utilize the magnetic component Z as tilt compensation can not be done without an Accelerometer
